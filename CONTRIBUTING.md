# How to contribute

Honestly I'm not expecting much interest in this...but it'd be awesome if there were! So here's me being optimistic:

## Project organization

* Branch `master` is always stable and release-ready.
* Branch `develop` is for development and merged into `master` when stable.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo, or make sure you are synced with the latest changes on `develop`.
2. Program
3. **Rebase on `develop` branch and resolve any conflicts _before submitting a pull request!_**
4. Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch.
